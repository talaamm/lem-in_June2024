# Moving All Ants in One Step
#In this scenario, you can move all ants from the start room to the end room in a single move.
# Each room can only contain one ant at a time (except at ##start and ##end which can contain as many ants as necessary).
#Explanation:
#Since the start room and end room are directly connected and the end room can hold all 20 ants simultaneously, you can execute this move in one step without any intermediate moves. This approach minimizes the number of turns required to complete the task, which is efficient and straightforward given the layout of the ant farm.
#Conclusion:
#Moving all ants together to the end room is a valid and efficient solution in this case, as it leverages the direct connection between the start and end rooms. This approach ensures that all ants reach their destination in the shortest possible time, adhering to the project's requirement to minimize the number of moves.
